                        <h2>Project</h2>
                        <p>Manko is an educational game aimed to help women enjoy their sexuality. 
                        The purpose of Manko is to end with the <span class="green">female sexuality taboo</span>.</p><br>
                        <p>Manko means <span class="green">“cunt” in Japanese</span> and it's a forbidden word there, as it is considered a very dirty and unrespectful word. 
                        </p><br>
                        <p>The name of the game is inspired by the manko-artist <span class="green">Rokudenashiko</span>, 
                         a Japanese women jailed because of doing art with her vagina. You can find out more about her story on her 
                         <a href="https://6d745.com/profile/" class="green" target="_blank">blog</a> or on her book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/What-Obscenity-Story-Nothing-Artist/dp/192766831X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1523848107&sr=8-1&keywords=what+is+obscenity" class="green" target="_blank">What is obscenity?</a>.</p>

                        <h2>Research</h2>
                        <p>The first approach to the subject was a survey where I verified that women had <span class="green">
                        little information about woman sexuality</span>. I also did a series of<span class="green">
                         interviews </span>that confirmed that a game teaching women (and men) about female masturbation was necessary.</p><br>
                        <div class="quotes">
                        <p class="cursiva">“The self-knowledge of our body is very important and for women is difficult, as it is something we don’t have visible, we have to open and look.”</p><br>
                        <p class="cursiva">“Sometimes I don’t know how to tell my sexual partner what I like cause I haven’t discover it yet”
                        </p><br>

                        <p>Based on the empathy map done with the insights of the surveys and the interviews I created Irene Árevalo, our user persona.</p>
