                        <h2>Project</h2>
                        <p>Manko is an educational game aimed to help women enjoy their sexuality. 
                        The purpose of Manko is to end with the <span class="green">female sexuality taboo</span>.</p><br>
                        <p>Manko means <span class="green">“cunt” in Japanese</span> and it's a forbidden word there, as it is considered a very dirty and unrespectful word. 
                        </p><br>
                        <p>The name of the game is inspired by the manko-artist <span class="green">Rokudenashiko</span>, 
                         a Japanese women jailed because of doing art with her vagina. You can find out more about her story on her 
                         <a href="https://6d745.com/profile/" class="green" target="_blank">blog</a> or on her book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/What-Obscenity-Story-Nothing-Artist/dp/192766831X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1523848107&sr=8-1&keywords=what+is+obscenity" class="green" target="_blank">What is obscenity?</a>.</p>

                        <h2>Research</h2>
                        <p>The first thing I did was <span class="green">research about female sexuality</span> to see what was out there about the subject. 
                        I found out something I already knew… female sexuality is a <span class="green">mystery for many woman and man.</span> I also found out about 
                        a very interesting term, the <span class="green">orgasm gap</span>. Several studies have been done about this matter and the results are that almost a 
                        50% of heterosexual woman didn’t orgasmed when sexually intimate against the 95% of heterosexual men who did orgasmed. 
                        <span class="green">This is a problem.</span> And why is this happening? Well, <span class="green">woman do not know what they like because they do not know their body</span>, 
                        among other reasons…
                        </p><br>
                        <p>After the first research on the subject I did a survey that verified that women had <span class="green">little information about woman sexuality</span> and that more of the 90% of the survey respondents 
                        answered that they wanted to expand their knowledge about female masturbation, against the 10% who think they already know everything about it. 
                        I also did a series of <span class="green">interviews</span> that confirmed that a game teaching women (and men) about female masturbation was necessary.</p><br>
                        <div class="quotes">
                        <p class="cursiva">“The self-knowledge of our body is very important and for women is difficult, as it is something we don’t have visible, we have to open and look.”</p><br>
                        <p class="cursiva">“Sometimes I don’t know how to tell my sexual partner what I like cause I haven’t discover it yet”
                        </p><br>

                        <h2>User Persona & User Journey</h2>
                        <p>Based on the empathy map done with the insights of the surveys and the interviews I created Irene Arévalo, our user persona. Irene is one of these woman who doesn’t usually 
                        orgasms during sexual intercourse. She has not explored her body therefore she doesn’t know what she likes and she can’t explain it to her sexual partners. Through the user journey 
                        I could identify the touchpoints where the app would help the user solve her problems.

                        <h2>Defining the app</h2>
                        <p>Defined the problem of my users and using the Lean UX methodology I defined the features that the game was going to have.  
                        <div class="features">
                        <p><span class="green">Game</span> with the information written and on an educational video before playing.</p>

                                <p>Before to start working on wireframes, I did a card sorting and defined the site map of the app so I could see the relationship between the features and the navigation of the user. 
                                I also did the user flow to see the path my user was going to take to complete the task. </p>

                        <p>To <span class="green">test </span>quickly the idea I did <span class="green">low fidelity wireframes</span>. With the feedback received I created the <span class="green">mid-fi wireframes</span> to test the user flows.</p>

                        <h2>UI Design</h2>
                        <p>The visual language  of the app had to represent: <span class="green">Freshness, woman empowerment, sexuality and fun.</span> To define the visual tone I made a moodboard that expressed those concepts through images and colors. 
                                After that I did the style tile which led me to create the style guide for the app. </p>

                         <h2>Conclusions</h2>
                         <p>After the tests with the users, this is what Manko achieves: gives woman (and man who want to discover how female 
                        pleasure works) the <span class="green">tools to explore their sexuality</span> and thus get to know what they like and be able to
                        explain it to their sexual partners in order to <span class="green">reach orgasms in every sexual relationship they have.</span>

                        <p>Here you can find the prototype of the MVP of the app. It is not a full working prototype but it helped me to test the app and learn what the next steps are. The other techniques need to be developed
                          and the Advices part.</p>
